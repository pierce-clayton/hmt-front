# How Much Time?

Do you ever wonder how much time is left until a certain event? Wonder no longer.

Do you ever wonder how much time has passed since something has happened? Now you don't have to.

Do you want to set up a series of timers and be able to log back in and check on them again later to see how much the time has changed? You are one of today's lucky 30,000 people.

Do you like charming snowy scenes that are gently animated? You won't find it anywhere but here.

## Introduction

How Much Time is a Javascript frontend and Rails backend application where I learned about communication from a server to an app, but also how to manipulate the browser DOM using Javascript.

## Rails

The backend for this project is Rails. It is fairly light for this project. The information it stores is the user name and the date objects they create. This provides persistence and allows multiple users to have their own timers. The user authentication is name only.

## Javascript

The frontend code to make the timers work and coutdown is written in Javascript. I used ES6 syntax as much as I could. The biggest takeaway for me coding all of this program's functionality is how much a frmework would be beneficial for this type of thing. This would be far simpler to code and understand as code if it were written in React.
